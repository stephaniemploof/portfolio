    <h1>Hi, I'm Stephanie.</h1>
    <h3>I'm a seasoned communicator crafting simple and effective solutions for complex systems. My diverse background in PR, communications, and design helps me create functional and intuitive digital products.</h3>
    <h3>For as long as I can remember, I've always been passionate about two things: making art and learning new technologies. They were always separate for me until I discovered UX/UI design. I decided to invest in several certifications and boot camps, including Avocademy's UX/UI Foundations Bootcamp and General Assemblyâ€™s Front-End Web Development Certification, to learn all I could about the industry and become well versed in website design and development.</h3>
    <h3>With every project I take on, I aim to further develop my design skills and create seamless user interfaces that make life easier.</h3>
