Questions as of 10/17/23:
My questions: 

1: For some reason, adding a grid on the homepage created so much additional space that I can't seem to remove. 

2: I believe we discussed in the last class, but I cannot figure out how to have a form send to an email. I will review the last class recording, but if you know off the top of your head, that would be helpful. 

3: I know how to access the URL to my github portal, but if you could help me link the URL for additional pages I have to my buttons, that would be helpful!
